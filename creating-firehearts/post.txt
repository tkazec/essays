*Creating Firehearts*

_js1k is a competition to create cool demos in no more than 1024 bytes of JavaScript. This post is about how I created my entry for their Love '12 contest. Check it out here: http://js1k.com/2012-love/demo/1252_

For a while I'd been wanting to enter a js1k competition, but could never think of a good demo idea. However, when their latest one was announced with the theme of "Love", I remembered something else I'd been wanting to do for a whileâ€”fireworks in JavaScript. Adding a love component was an obvious step and so, having decided, I started work on it.

*Base*
Fortunately for me, back in summer 2011, jsdo.it hosted a fireworks competition (http://jsdo.it/event/html5hanabi) and kindly provided a very nice sample. I took that and proceeded to pull out various unnecessary and/or unused components, including the DOM stuff, the tiny requestAnimationFrame() shim, and the firework settings (which I then hardcoded). This ended up reducing the unminified character count from about 4k to 1k: https://github.com/tkazec/demos/blob/2dba610b9b8ae847f0eb58d9014ecaf17c02fa84/2012-love.js

*Hearts*
Now I had a nice base... But all it generated was boring normal fireworks. Time for some hearts! Not satisfied with the normal unicode ones, I found a nice design in another entry (http://js1k.com/2012-love/demo/1047). After pulling out some unnecessary code and adding scaling, it was a drop in replacement for the circles.

*Tweaks*
What followed was quite a lot of fiddling around and experimenting. One of the hardest parts of development was figuring out the burst queuing, but I eventually figured out a nice and simple solution. I also ended up re-adding the tiny rAF() shim once I realized I had enough space left. While not entirely necessary, it provided a major increase in smoothness.

*Randomness*
Lacking much space for sequencing or interactivity, adding randomness was an affordable way to make the fireworks prettier and more interesting. Almost every variable is randomized to some degree, including the colors which are taken from a list of 6 simple "love"-y hues.

*Minification*

*Packing*

*Interactivity*
